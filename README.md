# Popular Movies
This is an android movie app that displays the current top movies. The app initially displays the most popular movies, although the user can specify in the settings if they want to see a list of the highest rated movies instead. Selecting a movie will open a details page where the user can see more info about the movie, including the release date, user rating, and movie description.

Note: The app uses The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/). If you want to fork the app and run it, you will need to register for your own free API key from the above site and add it in your gradle.properties file (e.g., MyMovieDbApiKey="YOUR_API_KEY").
